### Music Store Database Analysis with Questionnaire-Driven Data Extraction and Schema Visualization
This project is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis of a Music Store database. The primary objectives are to extract and analyze data in response to a set of specific questions outlined in the "Music Store Analysis-Questions" file. Additionally, a schema has been included in the "MusicDatabaseSchema" file to facilitate a deeper understanding of the database's table relationships. Furthermore, the project provides solution queries, which can be found in the Music Store query file.
